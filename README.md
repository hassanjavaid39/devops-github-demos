# 🚀 DevOps Projects Portfolio

Hi, I'm Hassan Javaid – a DevOps Engineer with over 2+ years of hands-on experience working with Terraform, CI/CD pipelines, cloud infrastructure, and monitoring systems.  
This repository contains some of my personal and demo projects that showcase my practical knowledge in key DevOps areas.

## 📁 Projects Included

### 1️⃣ Terraform – Azure VM Demo
📂 `terraform-azure-vm-demo/`  
This project uses Terraform to provision a basic infrastructure setup in Azure including:

- Resource Group
- Virtual Network (VNet)

All resources are managed via code using `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, and `outputs.tf`.  
Great for demonstrating Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in a real-world scenario.

### 2️⃣ CI/CD Pipeline – Node.js App
📂 `github-actions-nodejs-pipeline/`  
This is a simple Node.js application integrated with a GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow.

- Runs automatically on push to the `main` branch
- Installs dependencies and runs the app
- Defined in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`

This pipeline demonstrates how to automate deployments using GitHub Actions in a minimal setup.

### 3️⃣ Monitoring Stack – Prometheus + Grafana + Alertmanager
📂 `monitoring-full-stack/`  
This is a containerized monitoring solution using Docker Compose. The stack includes:

- **Prometheus**: scrapes system and app metrics  
- **Node Exporter**: collects host-level metrics  
- **Grafana**: displays dashboards  
- **Alertmanager**: handles alert routing and notifications

An alert rule is also included to trigger when CPU usage exceeds a threshold.
